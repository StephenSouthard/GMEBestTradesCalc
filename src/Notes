Need to finish adding in the 5 min different percentages using: 

SP500.setFiveMinPercentChanges(Element row, Company nextCompany, MarketTimesOpenClose times,
			TodaysDate todaysDate)  
			
	When I call this.document = Jsoup.connect(url).get(); (line 134) it takes a while to load.
	Find a way to collect the 5 min data from each ticker's personal page; and faster than it is.
	
	
Possibly make the Company data structure into a DoublyLinkedHashMap, instead of a DoublyLinkedList
